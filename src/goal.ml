(*
  A goal is an expression that we eventually want to obtain.

  Because it takes several turns and various unexpected accidents,
  we specify the expression as a goal.

  Ways of achieving the goal include:
  - using partial applications and values in the proponent slot
  - copying and using values from the opponent
